# Insta_handle

## Branding ideas
- We want our charts to be recognisable as coming from 'our Instagram handle', and to stand out in feeds
- We could use red (#EC111A) as the main or highlight colour, with more subtle blues/greys as the secondary colours. There are exceptions such as political charts which use party colours, or some maps where colours might have specific associations
- It’s okay to be flexible when needed, as long as there’s a strong template to fall back on
